8	1	Listen up! Wisdom is calling out, understanding is raising its voice.
8	2	At the highest point along the road, where the paths meet, wisdom takes its stand.
8	3	Beside the gates at the entrance to the city, wisdom cries aloud:
8	4	"I'm talking to you, people! I'm calling out to everyone!"
8	5	You simple ones, learn to be smart! You fools, get some common sense!
8	6	Listen, because I have important things to say. Everything I say is right.
8	7	My words are true, and I hate lies.
8	8	Everything I say is honest and fair; nothing is twisted or crooked.
8	9	My words are clear to anyone with understanding, and easy to see for those who know what's right.
8	10	Choose my instruction over silver, and knowledge over gold.
8	11	Wisdom is more valuable than rubies, and nothing you desire compares to me.
8	12	I, wisdom, live with understanding and possess knowledge and good judgment.
8	13	To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride, arrogance, evil behavior, and twisted words.
8	14	I offer guidance and success; I understand and have power.
8	15	Because of me, kings reign, and rulers make just laws.
8	16	I give wisdom to princes, nobles, and all who judge fairly.
8	17	I love those who love me, and those who search for me will find me.
8	18	I have riches and honor, enduring wealth and justice.
8	19	My gifts are better than pure gold or silver.
8	20	I walk in the path of righteousness, along the way of justice.
8	21	I make those who love me rich and fill their treasuries.
8	22	The Lord created me at the beginning, before his works of old.
8	23	I was formed long ages ago, at the very beginning, when the world began.
8	24	I was born when there were no oceans, no springs overflowing with water.
8	25	I was born before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills.
8	26	I was born before God made the earth, the fields, or even the first dust.
8	27	I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep.
8	28	When he established the clouds above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep.
8	29	When he gave the sea its boundaries so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.
8	30	Then I was the craftsman at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence,
8	31	rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind.
8	32	Now then, my children, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways.
8	33	Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not disregard it.
8	34	Blessed are those who listen to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway.
8	35	For those who find me find life and receive favor from the Lord.
8	36	But those who fail to find me harm themselves; all who hate me love death.
